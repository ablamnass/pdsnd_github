### Project Title
Post your Work on GitHub

### Description
Our goal is to publish the previous work we have done using R on GitHub.
The first part consist of loading the necessary files in order to get a 
consistant state with the previous project while recording each actions  
in the project README.md file. I used R to answer three questions in the 
investigation of data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington).

### Files used
Source files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv
