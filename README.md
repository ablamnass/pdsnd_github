### Project Title
Post your Work on GitHub

### Description
Our goal is to publish the previous work we have done using R on GitHub.
The first part consist of loading the necessary files in order to get a 
consistant state with the previous project while recording each actions  
in the project README.md file. I used R to answer three questions in the 
investigation of data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington).
The first question was to find out the most common month in the dataset.
In order to get satisfactory result, we decided to generate a new dataset 
combining the information collected from the three different cities and 
then we used ggplot to facilitate the interpretation of our answer through 
visualization. In the last two questions where we were asked to count the 
number of users according to their type (customer and subscriber) as well 
as the count of users based on the gender (male and female). Since these 
questions have some similarities, we decided to go for two different 
approaches. When dealing with the second question we used function and in 
the final question we explored some built-in functions of R such as table, 
factor, collection and so on. Then we endorsed our findings with some 
statistical diagrams.
